# A small summer CTF challenge

Three small challenges, three "flags" to capture, with access to the source code. Your challenge is as follows:

1) Spot the bug
2) Explain how it can be exploited
3) Demonstrate an exploit
4) Explain how to prevent, mitigate or fix the bug

All three of these challenges are based on very real bugs I've encountered in wild, though the code has been simplified for demonstration purposes. See the README files in each challenge directory for information on each challenge.
